# OSINT_Tools
A Repo for in-house Scripts developed by the Shandymen. These will mostly be developed in Python, so it would be good to have the following stuff installed!

| Name | How To Install |
| ---- | -------------- |
| **Python 3.8** | Download and Install from here: https://www.python.org/downloads |
| **Requests** | In Command Prompt, run the command: *pip install requests* (Requires Python) |
 

Anyways, take a look through our Library. It is constantly getting updated. 
If you have any requests, reach out to us!

| Script | Description | Additional Dependencies |
