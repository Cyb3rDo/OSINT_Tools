# OSINT_Tools
A Repo for in-house Scripts developed by the Shandymen. These will mostly be developed in Python, so it would be good to have the following stuff installed!

| Name | How To Install |
| ---- | -------------- |
| **Python 3.8** | Download and Install from here: https://www.python.org/downloads |
| **Requests** | In Command Prompt, run the command: *pip install requests* (Requires Python) |
 

Anyways, take a look through our Library. It is constantly getting updated. 
All of our Scripts include the **-h** flag. Use this to bring up the Help Menu!
If you have any requests, reach out to us!

| Script | Description | Additional Dependencies |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------- |
|[**HashScan.py**](https://github.com/Shandymen/OSINT_Tools/blob/master/HashScan.py) | A simple Script that searches for any Hash (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc) or list of hashes on Hashes.org (https://hashes.org), and attempts to find the decrypted plaintext message. API Key is required (Which is free!) | N/A |
| [**TorGrab.py**](https://github.com/Shandymen/OSINT_Tools/blob/master/TorGrab.py) | TorGrab takes a query and scans the DarkWeb for related .Onion Sites. It then automatically saves those websites to a CSV. | BeautifulSoup4 - *pip install bs4* |
